- 👋 Hi, I’m @eternally-voiceless
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development, Web Development (Frontend as much as Backend), Game Design and Development, and Data Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Python, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, and then I'm going to learn some frameworks on each items above. 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anyone yet, I've just started learning and then going to find a job as a software developer or web developer.
- 📫 I wrote this primarily for myself to stick to my own plan.
